## MLFlow

MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It is designed to help data scientists and machine learning engineers with various aspects of the machine learning process, including experimentation, reproducibility, model tracking, and deployment.
It allows you to log and track all aspects of your machine learning experiments, including hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts. This helps data scientists and researchers keep a record of what experiments have been conducted, compare the results of different runs, and understand how changes to parameters impact model performance.

- MLflow's Model Registry allows you to version and organize machine learning models.
- MLflow is designed to be user-friendly and easy to integrate into existing workflows.
- MLflow has a growing community and ecosystem of users and contributors.
- MLflow offers tools and integrations for serving and deploying models at scale. It supports different deployment targets, including cloud platforms, Kubernetes, and more.
